# telegram-aquabot

Telegram bot to provide information from various sources, like SocialSchoolCMS for news items and agenda.

Created because I wanted to have the information come to me instead of having to go and look at a small info frame on a school's website. Also, Telegram is pretty cool.

Uses [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) and some [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to make sense of some awful HTML.
